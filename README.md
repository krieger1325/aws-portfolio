## Welcome to my AWS Cloud Engineer Portfolio!

This portfolio showcases 10 real-world projects to demonstrate my  
skills in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, data engineering, security, and automation.  

## About Me

I am passionate about cloud architecture, automation, and scalable solutions.
I love working in the various cloud platforms and Linux and currently hold the following certifications: GCP ACE,  
Linux+, Security+, Network+, A+. In my spare  
time I love being with my family, running, and watching football.  

I built this portfolio to demonstrate hands-on experience with AWS services.
